***FIX***
(Terrain.cpp)
Terrain rendering with heightmaps
-Indices not being fully filled leading to partial mesh
-Issues with calculating the tangent and binormal that cause the grid to fail with textures
-Textures showing up on the wrong side of the mesh in regards to normal
-I am just going to do everything in the terrain but I really didnt want to...
[SOLVED]: Issue was that the index buffers were not being set to the correct amount.

(Level.cpp)
See what is up with 3 terrains being created when level loads.
-Look into the file traversal for the XML file.
